Welcome to the Disrupt AI Hackathon!

Team Number: \$1

Code: \$2

This guide will show you how to get your team access to your Azure credits for
the hackathon

-   Each team receives \$150 in Azure credits

-   **\*Only one**\* team member should complete the steps in this guide

-   All team members using Azure will require a Microsoft account

 

Step 1: Create a Microsoft account
----------------------------------

In order to use Azure you require a Microsoft account. Each team member who
wishes access to the Azure subscription will need a Microsoft account.

### What is a Microsoft Account?

A Microsoft account is an all-access pass to Microsoft's premier services,
helping you get things done, have more fun, and stay in touch. Your Microsoft
account lets you manage everything all in one place. Keep tabs on your
subscriptions and order history, organize your family's digital life, update
your privacy and security settings, track the health and safety of your devices,
and get rewards. Everything stays with you in the cloud and across devices,
including iOS and Android.

### Already have a Microsoft account?

If you have a \@outlook.com; \@live.com; \@hotmail.com; or \@msn.com account
these are already registered as Microsoft accounts and you can skip ahead to
[Step 2](#_Step_2:_Create) Create your team Azure subscription.

### Don’t have a Microsoft account?

You can each of your team members can create one by either creating a new
Microsoft account and email address or by associating your existing email (e.g.
\@gmail.com; \@yahoo.com) with a Microsoft account.

Follow the instructions on [How to create a new Microsoft
Account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026324/microsoft-account-how-to-create).
